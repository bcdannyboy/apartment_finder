# Phase Contracts

## Phase 2 - Acquisition Pipeline

### Test Summary
- Test plan: _dev_docs/agent_reports/phase_tests_phase2.md
- Coverage: task schema and queue payload validation, Policy Gate enforcement, per-domain rate limits and politeness, Firecrawl adapter format rules with changeTracking and content_hash fallback, manual-only enforcement, audit logging completeness, error handling with policy-aware retries, deterministic scheduling inputs.
- Hard constraints and evidence model: same as Phase 1, with required evidence artifacts for every test case.
