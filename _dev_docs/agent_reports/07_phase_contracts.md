## Phase 8

### Test Summary
- UI uses API only; no direct database access in UI paths
- Evidence is surfaced for all facts, including in history views
- Change history is displayed with clear ordering and evidence links
- Compare and near-miss views validate inputs before API calls
- Regression suite is deterministic on frozen snapshots
- Evaluation metrics pass sanity checks for ranges and consistency
